In response to unexpected resistance to lip or jaw movements during speech, fluent speakers can use the difference between the somatosensory expectations of a speech sound and the actual somatosensory feedback to adjust the trajectories of functionally relevant but unimpeded articulators. In an effort to investigate the neural substrates underlying the somatosensory feedback control of speech, we used an event-related sparse sampling functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm and a novel pneumatic device that unpredictably blocked subjects' jaw movements. In comparison to speech, perturbed speech, in which jaw perturbation prompted the generation of compensatory speech motor commands, demonstrated increased effects in bilateral ventral motor cortex, right-lateralized anterior supramarginal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis and ventral premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior posterior cerebellum (lobule VIII). Structural equation modeling revealed a significant increased influence from left anterior supramarginal gyrus to right anterior supramarginal gyrus and from left anterior supramarginal gyrus to right ventral premotor cortex as well as a significant increased reciprocal influence between right ventral premotor cortex and right ventral motor cortex and right anterior supramarginal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis for perturbed speech relative to speech. These results suggest that bilateral anterior supramarginal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis, right ventral premotor and motor cortices are functionally coupled and influence speech motor output when somatosensory feedback is unexpectedly perturbed during speech production.","note":"","tags":"Adult,Biomechanics,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Data Interpretation, Statistical,Electric Stimulation,Feedback, Physiological,Female,Functional Laterality,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Jaw,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Oxygen,Phonetics,Physical Stimulation,Psychomotor Performance,Speech,Young Adult","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Golfinopoulos2011","howpublished":""},

A fundamental question is whether the substantial brain growth and related changes in brain morphology that occur in early childhood permit valid comparisons of brain structure and function across ages. Here we investigated whether valid comparisons can be made in children from ages 4 to 11, and whether there are differences in the use of volume-based versus surface-based registration approaches for aligning structural landmarks across these ages. Regions corresponding to the calcarine sulcus, central sulcus, and Sylvian fissure in both the hemispheres were manually labeled on T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images from 31 children ranging in age from 4.2 to 11.2years old. Quantitative measures of shape similarity and volumetric-overlap of these manually labeled regions were calculated when brains were aligned using a 12-parameter affine transform, SPM's nonlinear normalization, a diffeomorphic registration (ANTS), and FreeSurfer's surface-based registration. Registration error for normalization into a common reference framework across participants in this age range was lower than commonly used functional imaging resolutions. Surface-based registration provided significantly better alignment of cortical landmarks than volume-based registration. In addition, registering children's brains to a common space does not result in an age-associated bias between older and younger children, making it feasible to accurately compare structural properties and patterns of brain activation in children from ages 4 to 11.","note":"Supplementary material: http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1721.1\/75815","tags":"Aging,Algorithms,Brain,Child, Preschool,Cognition,Female,Humans,Image Enhancement,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Male,Neurosciences,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Subtraction Technique","weight":"3","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Ghosh2010","howpublished":""},

However, there are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.","note":"","tags":"Adult,Algorithms,Brain,Female,Head,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Organ Size,Software,Young Adult","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Klein2010","howpublished":""},

Experiment 1 investigated the representation of prototypical (good) and nonprototypical (bad) examples of a vowel sound. Listening to prototypical examples of a vowel resulted in less auditory cortical activation than did listening to nonprototypical examples. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated the effects of categorization training and discrimination training with novel nonspeech sounds on auditory cortical representations. The 2 training tasks were shown to have opposite effects on the auditory cortical representation of sounds experienced during training: Discrimination training led to an increase in the amount of activation caused by the training stimuli, whereas categorization training led to decreased activation. These results indicate that the brain efficiently shifts neural resources away from regions of acoustic space where discrimination between sounds is not behaviorally important (e.g., near the center of a sound category) and toward regions where accurate discrimination is needed. The results also provide a straightforward neural account of learned aspects of perceptual distortion near sound categories: Sounds from the center of a category are more difficult to discriminate from each other than sounds near category boundaries because they are represented by fewer cells in the auditory cortical areas.","note":"","tags":"Acoustic Stimulation,Adolescent,Adult,Auditory Cortex,Auditory Threshold,Brain Mapping,Dominance, Cerebral,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Speech Discrimination Tests,Speech Perception","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1092-4388","isi":"","key":"Guenther2004","howpublished":""},

In each of these contexts, accurate estimation of the BOLD signal in as little time as possible is desired. This is a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data. Previous methods for real-time fMRI analysis have either sacrificed the ability to compute moment-to-moment activation changes by averaging several acquisitions into a single activation estimate or have sacrificed accuracy by failing to account for prominent sources of noise in the fMRI signal. Here we present a new method for computing the amount of activation present in a single fMRI acquisition that separates moment-to-moment changes in the fMRI signal intensity attributable to neural sources from those due to noise, resulting in a feedback signal more reflective of neural activation. This method computes an incremental general linear model fit to the fMRI time series, which is used to calculate the expected signal intensity at each new acquisition. The difference between the measured intensity and the expected intensity is scaled by the variance of the estimator in order to transform this residual difference into a statistic. Both synthetic and real data were used to validate this method and compare it to the only other published real-time fMRI method.","note":"","tags":"Biofeedback, Psychology,Computing Methodologies,Feedback, Physiological,Feedback, Psychological,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Kinetics,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Oxygen,Reproducibility of Results,Signal Transduction","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Hinds2011","howpublished":""},

In addition, we validate our tool on a simple motor task where we demonstrate an average prediction accuracy of over 90%. Our experiments demonstrate that the classifier performance depends significantly on the complexity of the experimental design and the mental process of interest.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"","isi":"","key":"Balci2008","howpublished":""},

However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http:\/\/nipy.org\/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage.

The production of running speech comprises the traversing of spatial positions with precisely coordinated articulator movements to produce 10-15 sounds\/s. How does the brain use auditory feedback, namely the self-perception of produced speech sounds, in the online control of spatial and temporal parameters of multisyllabic articulation? This question has important bearings on the organizational principles of sequential actions, yet its answer remains controversial due to the long latency of the auditory feedback pathway and technical challenges involved in manipulating auditory feedback in precisely controlled ways during running speech. In this study, we developed a novel technique for introducing time-varying, focal perturbations in the auditory feedback during multisyllabic, connected speech. Manipulations of spatial and temporal parameters of the formant trajectory were tested separately on two groups of subjects as they uttered \"I owe you a yo-yo.\" Under these perturbations, significant and specific changes were observed in both the spatial and temporal parameters of the produced formant trajectories. Compensations to spatial perturbations were bidirectional and opposed the perturbations. Furthermore, under perturbations that manipulated the timing of auditory feedback trajectory (slow-down or speed-up), significant adjustments in syllable timing were observed in the subjects' productions. These results highlight the systematic roles of auditory feedback in the online control of a highly over-learned action as connected speech articulation and provide a first look at the properties of this type of sensorimotor interaction in sequential movements.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1529-2401","isi":"","key":"Cai2011","howpublished":""},

Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-5196","isi":"","key":"Poline2012","howpublished":""},

The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science.   We highlight five salient problems: (1) Reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) Reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) Reviewers are not acknowledged; (4) There is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) Reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer?s specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer, enabling a more comprehensive and timely review. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, replication of results and enable greater scrutiny by people from different fields using different nomenclature, leading to greater clarity and cross-fertilization of ideas. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be integrated with assessments for promotions and grants. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of reviewers and information generated during a review, and assess the importance of a submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialogue to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be addressed by building upon computer programming code management systems. In this article, we provide examples of current code review systems that offer opportunities for addressing the above problems, and offer suggestions for enhancing code review systems for article review.","note":"","tags":"code review systems,distributed peer review,open source software development,post-publication peer review","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-5188","isi":"","key":"Ghosh2012","howpublished":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/Abstract.aspx?s=237&name=computational_neuroscience&ART_DOI=10.3389\/fncom.2012.00018"},

Researchers have theorized that an important neural basis of stuttering is the aberrant integration of auditory information into incipient speech motor commands. Because of the circumstantial support for these hypotheses and the differences and contradictions between them, there is a need for carefully designed experiments that directly examine auditory-motor integration during speech production in PWS. In the current study, we used real-time manipulation of auditory feedback to directly investigate whether the speech motor system of PWS utilizes auditory feedback abnormally during articulation and to characterize potential deficits of this auditory-motor integration. Twenty-one PWS and 18 fluent control participants were recruited. Using a short-latency formant-perturbation system, we examined participants' compensatory responses to unanticipated perturbation of auditory feedback of the first formant frequency during the production of the monophthong [\u03b5]. The PWS showed compensatory responses that were qualitatively similar to the controls' and had close-to-normal latencies (\u223c150 ms), but the magnitudes of their responses were substantially and significantly smaller than those of the control participants (by 47% on average, p<0.05). Measurements of auditory acuity indicate that the weaker-than-normal compensatory responses in PWS were not attributable to a deficit in low-level auditory processing. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that stuttering is associated with functional defects in the inverse models responsible for the transformation from the domain of auditory targets and auditory error information into the domain of speech motor commands.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1932-6203","isi":"","key":"Cai2012","howpublished":""},

As such, the sparse-sampling technique has become a mainstay of principled fMRI research into the cognitive and systems neuroscience of speech, language, hearing, and music. Despite being in use for over a decade, there has been little systematic investigation of the acquisition parameters, experimental design considerations, and statistical analysis approaches that bear on the results and interpretation of sparse-sampling fMRI experiments. In this report, we examined how design and analysis choices related to the duration of repetition time (TR) delay (an acquisition parameter), stimulation rate (an experimental design parameter), and model basis function (an analysis parameter) act independently and interactively to affect the neural activation profiles observed in fMRI. First, we conducted a series of computational simulations to explore the parameter space of sparse design and analysis with respect to these variables; second, we validated the results of these simulations in a series of sparse-sampling fMRI experiments. Overall, these experiments suggest the employment of three methodological approaches that can, in many situations, substantially improve the detection of neurophysiological response in sparse fMRI: (1) Sparse analyses should utilize a physiologically informed model that incorporates hemodynamic response convolution to reduce model error. (2) The design of sparse fMRI experiments should maintain a high rate of stimulus presentation to maximize effect size. (3) TR delays of short to intermediate length can be used between acquisitions of sparse-sampled functional image volumes to increase the number of samples and improve statistical power.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-4548","isi":"","key":"Perrachione2013","howpublished":""},

In the current study, we analyzed the results from probabilistic tractography between regions comprising the cortical speech network. An anatomical parcellation scheme was used to define 28 speech production-related ROIs in each hemisphere. We used network-based statistic (NBS) and graph theory to analyze the connectivity patterns obtained from tractography. At the network-level, the probabilistic corticocortical connectivity from the PWS group were significantly weaker than that from persons with fluent speech (PFS). NBS analysis revealed significant components in the bilateral speech networks with negative correlations with stuttering severity. To facilitate comparison with previous studies, we also performed tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and regional fractional anisotropy (FA) averaging. Results from tractography, TBSS and regional FA averaging jointly highlight the importance of several regions in the left peri-Rolandic sensorimotor and premotor areas, most notably the left ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) and middle primary motor cortex, in the neuroanatomical basis of stuttering.","note":"","tags":"","weight":28,"publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-5161","isi":"","key":"Cai2014","howpublished":""},

Recent studies based on AF perturbation provided evidence for abnormalities in the integration of auditory error with ongoing articulation and phonation in persons who stutter (PWS), but stopped short of examining connected speech. This is a crucial limitation considering the importance of sequencing and timing in stuttering. In the current study, we imposed time-varying perturbations on AF while PWS and fluent participants uttered a multisyllabic sentence. Two distinct types of perturbations were used to separately probe the control of the spatial and temporal parameters of articulation. While PWS exhibited only subtle anomalies in the AF-based spatial control, their AF-based fine-tuning of articulatory timing was substantially weaker than normal, especially in early parts of the responses, indicating slowness in the auditory-motor integration for temporal control.","note":"","tags":"","weight":29,"publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1090-2155","isi":"","key":"Cai2014","howpublished":""},

Reading fluency deficits are a persistent behavioral marker of dyslexia into adulthood. The current study identified the neural correlates of fluent reading in typical and dyslexic adult readers, using sentences presented in a word-by-word format in which single words were presented sequentially at fixed rates. Sentences were presented at slow, medium, and fast rates, and participants were asked to decide whether each sentence did or did not make sense semantically. As presentation rates increased, participants became less accurate and slower at making judgments, with comprehension accuracy decreasing disproportionately for dyslexic readers. In-scanner performance on the sentence task correlated significantly with standardized clinical measures of both reading fluency and phonological awareness. Both typical readers and readers with dyslexia exhibited widespread, bilateral increases in activation that corresponded to increases in presentation rate. Typical readers exhibited significantly larger gains in activation as a function of faster presentation rates than readers with dyslexia in several areas, including left prefrontal and left superior temporal regions associated with semantic retrieval and semantic and phonological representations. Group differences were more extensive when behavioral differences between conditions were equated across groups. These findings suggest a brain basis for impaired reading fluency in dyslexia, specifically a failure of brain regions involved in semantic retrieval and semantic and phonological representations to become fully engaged for comprehension at rapid reading rates.","note":"","tags":"","weight":30,"publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1932-6203","isi":"","key":"Christodoulou2014","howpublished":""},

We review the scientific potential of rtfMRI and outline research strategies to optimize the development and application of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a next generation therapeutic tool. We propose that rtfMRI can be used to address a broad range of clinical problems by improving our understanding of brain-behavior relationships in order to develop more specific and effective interventions for individuals with brain disorders. We focus on the use of rtfMRI neurofeedback as a clinical neurotherapeutic tool to drive plasticity in brain function, cognition, and behavior. Our overall goal is for rtfMRI to advance personalized assessment and intervention approaches to enhance resilience and reduce morbidity by correcting maladaptive patterns of brain function in those with brain disorders.","note":"","tags":"","weight":32,"publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"2213-1582","isi":"","key":"Stoeckel2014","howpublished":""},

Pre-treatment resting-state brain functional connectivity and diffusion-weighted structural connectivity were measured in 38 patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) to predict subsequent treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used a priori bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in social anxiety after CBT. Each connectomic measure improved the prediction of individuals' treatment outcomes significantly better than a clinical measure of initial severity, and combining the multimodal connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse responders, logistic regression of connectomic predictors and initial severity combined with leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a categorical prediction of clinical improvement with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Connectomics of the human brain, measured by widely available imaging methods, may provide brain-based biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting precision medicine that better guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available treatments, and thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 11 August 2015; doi:10.1038\/mp.2015.109.","note":"","tags":"","weight":33,"publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1476-5578","isi":"","key":"Whitfield-Gabrieli2015","howpublished":""},
