### 6.541 Speech Communication
  <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp13/6.541" class="badge">
  Course website</a>

  Speech Communication is an H-LEVEL graduate course (3-1-8) that surveys human
  speech communication with special emphasis on the sound patterns of natural
  languages. Acoustic theory of speech production; physiologic and acoustic
  descriptions of phonetic features, prosody, speech perception, speech
  respiration, and speech motor control. Applications to recognition and
  generation of speech by machine and to speech disorders.

### 6.551 Acoustics of Speech and Hearing
  <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa12/6.551j" class="badge">
  Course website</a>

  The Acoustics of Speech and Hearing is an H-Level graduate course (4-1-7) that
  reviews the physical processes involved in the production, propagation and
  reception of human speech with particular attention to how the the acoustics
  and mechanics of the speech and auditory system define what sounds we are
  capable of producing and what sounds we can sense. Particular attention will
  be paid to (1) the acoustic cues used in determining the direction of a sound
  source, (2) the acoustic and mechanical mechanisms involved in speech
  production and (3) the acoustic and mechanical mechanism used to transduce
  and analyze sounds in the ear.
