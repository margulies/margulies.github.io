In response to unexpected resistance to lip or jaw movements during speech, fluent speakers can use the difference between the somatosensory expectations of a speech sound and the actual somatosensory feedback to adjust the trajectories of functionally relevant but unimpeded articulators. In an effort to investigate the neural substrates underlying the somatosensory feedback control of speech, we used an event-related sparse sampling functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm and a novel pneumatic device that unpredictably blocked subjects' jaw movements. In comparison to speech, perturbed speech, in which jaw perturbation prompted the generation of compensatory speech motor commands, demonstrated increased effects in bilateral ventral motor cortex, right-lateralized anterior supramarginal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis and ventral premotor cortex, and bilateral inferior posterior cerebellum (lobule VIII). Structural equation modeling revealed a significant increased influence from left anterior supramarginal gyrus to right anterior supramarginal gyrus and from left anterior supramarginal gyrus to right ventral premotor cortex as well as a significant increased reciprocal influence between right ventral premotor cortex and right ventral motor cortex and right anterior supramarginal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis for perturbed speech relative to speech.

A fundamental question is whether the substantial brain growth and related changes in brain morphology that occur in early childhood permit valid comparisons of brain structure and function across ages. Here we investigated whether valid comparisons can be made in children from ages 4 to 11, and whether there are differences in the use of volume-based versus surface-based registration approaches for aligning structural landmarks across these ages. Regions corresponding to the calcarine sulcus, central sulcus, and Sylvian fissure in both the hemispheres were manually labeled on T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images from 31 children ranging in age from 4.2 to 11.2years old. Quantitative measures of shape similarity and volumetric-overlap of these manually labeled regions were calculated when brains were aligned using a 12-parameter affine transform, SPM's nonlinear normalization, a diffeomorphic registration (ANTS), and FreeSurfer's surface-based registration. Registration error for normalization into a common reference framework across participants in this age range was lower than commonly used functional imaging resolutions. Surface-based registration provided significantly better alignment of cortical landmarks than volume-based registration. In addition, registering children's brains to a common space does not result in an age-associated bias between older and younger children, making it feasible to accurately compare structural properties and patterns of brain activation in children from ages 4 to 11.","note":"Supplementary material: http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1721.1\/75815","tags":"Aging,Algorithms,Brain,Child, Preschool,Cognition,Female,Humans,Image Enhancement,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Male,Neurosciences,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Subtraction Technique","weight":"3","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Ghosh2010","howpublished":""},

A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.","note":"","tags":"Adult,Algorithms,Brain,Female,Head,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Organ Size,Software,Young Adult","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Klein2010","howpublished":""},

Experiment 1 investigated the representation of prototypical (good) and nonprototypical (bad) examples of a vowel sound. Listening to prototypical examples of a vowel resulted in less auditory cortical activation than did listening to nonprototypical examples. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated the effects of categorization training and discrimination training with novel nonspeech sounds on auditory cortical representations. The 2 training tasks were shown to have opposite effects on the auditory cortical representation of sounds experienced during training: Discrimination training led to an increase in the amount of activation caused by the training stimuli, whereas categorization training led to decreased activation. These results indicate that the brain efficiently shifts neural resources away from regions of acoustic space where discrimination between sounds is not behaviorally important (e.g., near the center of a sound category) and toward regions where accurate discrimination is needed. The results also provide a straightforward neural account of learned aspects of perceptual distortion near sound categories: Sounds from the center of a category are more difficult to discriminate from each other than sounds near category boundaries because they are represented by fewer cells in the auditory cortical areas.","note":"","tags":"Acoustic Stimulation,Adolescent,Adult,Auditory Cortex,Auditory Threshold,Brain Mapping,Dominance, Cerebral,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Speech Discrimination Tests,Speech Perception","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1092-4388","isi":"","key":"Guenther2004","howpublished":""},

In each of these contexts, accurate estimation of the BOLD signal in as little time as possible is desired. This is a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI data. Previous methods for real-time fMRI analysis have either sacrificed the ability to compute moment-to-moment activation changes by averaging several acquisitions into a single activation estimate or have sacrificed accuracy by failing to account for prominent sources of noise in the fMRI signal. Here we present a new method for computing the amount of activation present in a single fMRI acquisition that separates moment-to-moment changes in the fMRI signal intensity attributable to neural sources from those due to noise, resulting in a feedback signal more reflective of neural activation. This method computes an incremental general linear model fit to the fMRI time series, which is used to calculate the expected signal intensity at each new acquisition. The difference between the measured intensity and the expected intensity is scaled by the variance of the estimator in order to transform this residual difference into a statistic. Both synthetic and real data were used to validate this method and compare it to the only other published real-time fMRI method.","note":"","tags":"Biofeedback, Psychology,Computing Methodologies,Feedback, Physiological,Feedback, Psychological,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Kinetics,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Oxygen,Reproducibility of Results,Signal Transduction","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1095-9572","isi":"","key":"Hinds2011","howpublished":""},

However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http:\/\/nipy.org\/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting.

The production of running speech comprises the traversing of spatial positions with precisely coordinated articulator movements to produce 10-15 sounds\/s. How does the brain use auditory feedback, namely the self-perception of produced speech sounds, in the online control of spatial and temporal parameters of multisyllabic articulation? This question has important bearings on the organizational principles of sequential actions, yet its answer remains controversial due to the long latency of the auditory feedback pathway and technical challenges involved in manipulating auditory feedback in precisely controlled ways during running speech. In this study, we developed a novel technique for introducing time-varying, focal perturbations in the auditory feedback during multisyllabic, connected speech. Manipulations of spatial and temporal parameters of the formant trajectory were tested separately on two groups of subjects as they uttered \"I owe you a yo-yo.\" Under these perturbations, significant and specific changes were observed in both the spatial and temporal parameters of the produced formant trajectories. Compensations to spatial perturbations were bidirectional and opposed the perturbations. Furthermore, under perturbations that manipulated the timing of auditory feedback trajectory (slow-down or speed-up), significant adjustments in syllable timing were observed in the subjects' productions. These results highlight the systematic roles of auditory feedback in the online control of a highly over-learned action as connected speech articulation and provide a first look at the properties of this type of sensorimotor interaction in sequential movements.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1529-2401","isi":"","key":"Cai2011","howpublished":""},

Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-5196","isi":"","key":"Poline2012","howpublished":""},

The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science.   We highlight five salient problems: (1) Reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) Reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) Reviewers are not acknowledged; (4) There is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) Reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer?s specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer, enabling a more comprehensive and timely review. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, replication of results and enable greater scrutiny by people from different fields using different nomenclature, leading to greater clarity and cross-fertilization of ideas. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be integrated with assessments for promotions and grants. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of reviewers and information generated during a review, and assess the importance of a submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialogue to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be addressed by building upon computer programming code management systems. In this article, we provide examples of current code review systems that offer opportunities for addressing the above problems, and offer suggestions for enhancing code review systems for article review.","note":"","tags":"code review systems,distributed peer review,open source software development,post-publication peer review","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-5188","isi":"","key":"Ghosh2012","howpublished":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/Abstract.aspx?s=237&name=computational_neuroscience&ART_DOI=10.3389\/fncom.2012.00018"},

Researchers have theorized that an important neural basis of stuttering is the aberrant integration of auditory information into incipient speech motor commands. Because of the circumstantial support for these hypotheses and the differences and contradictions between them, there is a need for carefully designed experiments that directly examine auditory-motor integration during speech production in PWS. In the current study, we used real-time manipulation of auditory feedback to directly investigate whether the speech motor system of PWS utilizes auditory feedback abnormally during articulation and to characterize potential deficits of this auditory-motor integration. Twenty-one PWS and 18 fluent control participants were recruited. Using a short-latency formant-perturbation system, we examined participants' compensatory responses to unanticipated perturbation of auditory feedback of the first formant frequency during the production of the monophthong [\u03b5]. The PWS showed compensatory responses that were qualitatively similar to the controls' and had close-to-normal latencies (\u223c150 ms), but the magnitudes of their responses were substantially and significantly smaller than those of the control participants (by 47% on average, p<0.05). Measurements of auditory acuity indicate that the weaker-than-normal compensatory responses in PWS were not attributable to a deficit in low-level auditory processing. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that stuttering is associated with functional defects in the inverse models responsible for the transformation from the domain of auditory targets and auditory error information into the domain of speech motor commands.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1932-6203","isi":"","key":"Cai2012","howpublished":""},

We examined the roles of these brain regions in vigilance by triggering trials based on brain states defined by blood oxygenation level-dependent activation measured using real-time fMRI. When activation of relevant neural systems indicated either a good brain state (increased activation of SMA) or a bad brain state (increased activation of lateral parietal cortex and precuneus) for performance, a target was presented and RT was measured. RT on trials triggered by a good brain state were significantly faster than RT on trials triggered by a bad brain state. Thus, human performance was controlled by monitoring brain states that indicated high or low vigilance.

As such, the sparse-sampling technique has become a mainstay of principled fMRI research into the cognitive and systems neuroscience of speech, language, hearing, and music. Despite being in use for over a decade, there has been little systematic investigation of the acquisition parameters, experimental design considerations, and statistical analysis approaches that bear on the results and interpretation of sparse-sampling fMRI experiments. In this report, we examined how design and analysis choices related to the duration of repetition time (TR) delay (an acquisition parameter), stimulation rate (an experimental design parameter), and model basis function (an analysis parameter) act independently and interactively to affect the neural activation profiles observed in fMRI. First, we conducted a series of computational simulations to explore the parameter space of sparse design and analysis with respect to these variables; second, we validated the results of these simulations in a series of sparse-sampling fMRI experiments. Overall, these experiments suggest the employment of three methodological approaches that can, in many situations, substantially improve the detection of neurophysiological response in sparse fMRI: (1) Sparse analyses should utilize a physiologically informed model that incorporates hemodynamic response convolution to reduce model error. (2) The design of sparse fMRI experiments should maintain a high rate of stimulus presentation to maximize effect size. (3) TR delays of short to intermediate length can be used between acquisitions of sparse-sampled functional image volumes to increase the number of samples and improve statistical power.","note":"","tags":"","publisher":"","booktitle":"","editor":"","address":"","school":"","issn":"1662-4548","isi":"","key":"Perrachione2013","howpublished":""},

Sentences were presented at slow, medium, and fast rates, and participants were asked to decide whether each sentence did or did not make sense semantically. As presentation rates increased, participants became less accurate and slower at making judgments, with comprehension accuracy decreasing disproportionately for dyslexic readers. In-scanner performance on the sentence task correlated significantly with standardized clinical measures of both reading fluency and phonological awareness. Both typical readers and readers with dyslexia exhibited widespread, bilateral increases in activation that corresponded to increases in presentation rate. Typical readers exhibited significantly larger gains in activation as a function of faster presentation rates than readers with dyslexia in several areas, including left prefrontal and left superior temporal regions associated with semantic retrieval and semantic and phonological representations.
