My present research focuses on the following areas.

**Datamining:** Developing novel computational approaches for representing
multimodal data in the context of clinical disorders and to develop models
for diagnosing and predicting treatment outcome. This is currently being applied
to stuttering, social anxiety disorder (SAD), major depressive disorder (MDD),
among others.

**Realtime fMRI:** I am involved with the development and validation of
realtime-fMRI as a clinical tool in the context of projects funded by the DoD,
NIH and the McGovern Institute. These projects are aimed at cognitive
rehabilitation, development of portable biofeedback systems and improving
opensource realtime fMRI tools.

**Neuroinformatics:** In association with the [INCF](http://incf.org) and
[BIRN](https://wiki.birncommunity.org/display/FBIRN/Derived+Data+Working+Group),
we are developing a set of resources for integrating provenance and data in a
technology agnostic provenance model and providing semantic-web based query,
processing and visualization of such data.

**Opensource development:** I contribute to various opensource software
projects. As P.I. of an R03 from NIBIB I initiated the development of a
Python-based, open-source, multi-institution software project
[Nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype) that aims to improve interoperability among
existing imaging analysis software packages.

I have also been involved with real-time synthesis of computer music and sound
effects, controlling chaotic oscillators to generate different pitches and
timbres, computational modeling of speech acquisition and production, and
real-time DSP-based speech signal processing.
