My present research focuses on novel computational approaches for representing
multimodal data in the context of clinical disorders and to develop models
for diagnosing and predicting treatment outcome. This is currently being applied
to stuttering, social anxiety disorder (SAD), major depressive disorder (MDD),
among others. I am also involved with the development and validation of
realtime-fMRI as a clinical tool in the context of projects funded by the DoD,
NIH and the McGovern Institute.

In prior work I developed state-of-the-art tools for region of interest analysis
of neuroimaging data. As P.I. of an R03 from NIBIB I initiated the development
of a Python-based, open-source, multi-institution software project
[Nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype) that aims to improve interoperability among
existing imaging analysis software packages.

I have also been involved with real-time synthesis of computer music and sound
effects, controlling chaotic oscillators to generate different pitches and
timbres, computational modeling of speech acquisition and production, and
real-time DSP-based speech signal processing.
