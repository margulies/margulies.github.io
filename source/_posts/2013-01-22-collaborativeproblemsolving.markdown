A friend, Pablo Suarez, is running a competition to determine the best strategy
for winning in game called ["Pay for predictions"][PFP]. Our goal is to openly
and collaboratively help him, by providing some winning strategies for the game.
So spread the word!

<!-- more -->

The game intends to capture real life situations faced by the Red Cross Red
Crescent when dealing with natural disasters (e.g., flooding, earthquakes,
etc.,.). In keeping with the theme of collaborative problem solving as discussed
in the book ["Reinventing discovery" by Michael Nielsen][RID] and the approach
taken to use [games for social change][GFC], the idea behind this shout-out is
to contribute solutions to the challenge.

Towards this, I have setup a [Github repo][GHR] where everybody is welcome to
contribute. Do read the [guidelines][PFP] of the competition. It is possible
that there is a very simple solution, or one where a simulation can reveal the
optimal solution or many or none. The goal here is to demonstrate, much like the
["polymath project"][PP], that we can solve something quicker and possibly
better collaboratively. We understand that everybody may not have the time or
interest, but if you know someone who does, please let that person know.

Further, in keeping with the opensource spirit of scientific computation, I have
setup an [IPython notebook][IPN] to simulate the game. Based on the wonderful
work of the IPython team and contributors, this notebook can also deliver a
slideshow of the evolving solution. If you like Python, please contribute to the
notebook.

If you prefer something else, please add your code/document to your fork and
send a pull-request. Let us use the Github [pull-request system][GHPR],
[issue tracker][GHI] and [wiki][GHW] for discussions.

So come one and come all and help develop a winning strategy. Go
[fork and contribute][GHR]!
