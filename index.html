#### Who am I

I am a Principal Research Scientist at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](http://mcgovern.mit.edu/)
at MIT, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at Harvard
Medical School, and a faculty member in the [Speech and Hearing Biosciences and
Technology](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/) program in the Harvard Division of
Medical Sciences. You can find a [full CV here](assets/CV_Latest.pdf).

#### What do I do

My research interests span computer science and neuroimaging, specifically in
the areas of applied machine learning, signal processing, and translational
medicine. My current research portfolio brings together speech, brain imaging,
and informatics to address gaps in scientific knowledge from three perspectives:

1) **Speech and medicine:** Understanding speech mechanisms and applying speech
technology to healthcare, specifically psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and
speech motor control disorders.

2) **Machine learning for personalized medicine:** Integrating imaging, genetic, and
behavioral data using machine learning algorithms for clinical diagnosis and
treatment prediction.

3) **Neuroinformatics and reproducible research:** Establishing standards for
organizing scientific information and creating performant tools to address the
data deluge and reproducibility.Â 

My research group develops robust, predictive models around human
health and novel analytic platforms, and establishes collaborations across
disciplines. I am a lead architect of the [Nipype dataflow platform](http://nipy.org/nipype),
an ardent proponent of decentralized and distributed Web solutions for data
sharing, querying, and computing, and a strong believer in solving problems
together.
